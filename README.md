# Paint Maker Pro

```
Paint Maker Pro is a simple paint app for all ages.  
It was developed using Python and Kivy.  
Anyone can develop their creativity with this app.  
I plan to improve this app by adding more features suggested by users of Paint Maker Pro.  
Please provide your honest feedback.
```

* Using on Android
  * Install the app from Google Play: [Paint Maker Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pranav.pooruli.pmp)
  
  OR
  
  * Move the release APK file to your  
  Android device's Download folder.
  * Open up any file manager app on  
  your Android device and click on  
  the APK file.
  * Install it.
  * Paint!

**Note: Some users of Paint Maker Pro have complained that the Save as JPEG feature doesn't work. This is a bug that I am trying to fix. I am thinking that the Save as JPEG feature isn't working because of some Android permission error. I did include the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission while creating my APK files, but it seems just that permission wasn't enough. This bug should be fixed in the next release of Paint Maker Pro.**
